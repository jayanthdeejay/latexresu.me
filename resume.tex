\begin{cvsection}{Summary}
\hfill \break
I have been a jack of all trades, master of none, for most of my life, except for core competencies. Never worked on similar tech for more than three years in a row. Enthusiastic to learn and work on tech that I had never worked on before.\hfill \break \linebreak
Spent the last couple of years studying blockchain technologies ground up from consensus mechanisms to cryptographic algorithms, blockchains' evolution, underlying tech-stack, distributed Defi applications, etc. Before that, worked as a Ruby on Rails Full-Stack Development engineer as well as a DevOps Engineer. Saved over a quarter-million dollars a year in licensing and infrastructure costs by going for a fully open-source tech stack and research computing infrastructure.\hfill \break \linebreak
For my master's thesis, worked on a dynamic dial-a-ride implementation at UC and suggested solutions that theoretically reduced wait times and overall performance improvement by 30\%. Before joining UC, I worked at an international bank's primary data center as an IT Manager, as well as a Systems Engineer at an IT services company in India.
